âœ… Height-Balanced Binary Search Tree (HB-BST):

ðŸ”¹A general concept.

ðŸ”¹A BST is height-balanced if, for every node, the difference in height between left and right subtrees is at most 1.

ðŸ”¹This is what LeetCode usually means when it says "convert sorted array to a height-balanced BST".

âœ… AVL Tree 

ðŸ”¹A specific type of height-balanced BST.

ðŸ”¹It strictly enforces the balance factor (difference in heights of left and right subtree) to be -1, 0, or +1.

ðŸ”¹Every time you insert or delete, the tree performs rotations (LL, RR, LR, RL) to maintain balance.


Think of HB-BST as a general rule like "stay fit", while AVL Tree is a strict workout plan that ensures you're always within ideal BMI ðŸ˜‚
