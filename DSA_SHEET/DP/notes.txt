Dynamic Programming can be described as storing answers to various sub-problems to be used later whenever required to solve the main problem.

The two common dynamic programming approaches are:

Memoization: Known as the “top-down” dynamic programming, usually the problem is solved in the direction of the main problem to the base cases.

Tabulation: Known as the “bottom-up '' dynamic programming, usually the problem is solved in the direction of solving the base cases to the main problem

Note: The base case does not always mean smaller input. It depends upon the implementation of the algorithm.
