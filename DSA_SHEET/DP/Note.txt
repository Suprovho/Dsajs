use ind-1 or ind+1 it will work fine in most case we have to use ind+1 to avoid error in few question

but don't use ind+1 in tabulation

if we have ind-1 in tabulation we can do space optimization by taking 2 or 1 array in subsequence

where there is ind-1 replace with prev and ind with curr in tabulation in subsequence prblm if 2 array used in space optimization.

// use dp table to solve printing problem

means from n m to 0 in dp table of tabulation
